# week2 homework Exercise 1

## Step 1.1
How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?
- Answer:  3 * 1,000,000 / 100 = 30,000 reads

## Step 1.3
1. In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
- Answer:  50693 bases, which is 5.00% of the genome has not been sequenced in our simulation above.

2. How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
- Answer: Both the poisson and the normal distribution fits okay. But the poisson distribution fits better here, as the coverage is only 3x.

## Step 1.4
1. In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
- Answer: 86 bases, which is 0.0086% of the genome has not been sequenced in our simulation above.

2. How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
- Answer: Again both fits okay. The normal distribution seems to fits better here, as the coverage is 10x.

## Step 1.5
1. In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?
- Answer: 53 bases, which is 0.0053% of the genome has not been sequenced in our simulation above.

2. How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?
- Answer: Again both fits okay. The normal distribution seems to fits better here, as the coverage is 30x.

## Title: Exploring the Genomic Frontier: My Passion for Genomics as a Biologist

### Introduction

Genomics, the study of an organism's entire genetic makeup, has emerged as a captivating and dynamic field within biology. As a biologist, my fascination with genomics has grown steadily over the years, driven by the profound impact it has on our understanding of life, evolution, and human health. In this essay, I will elucidate the reasons behind my deep interest in genomics, drawing on both personal experiences and the ever-evolving body of scientific knowledge.

### Unraveling the Blueprint of Life
At the core of genomics lies the fundamental quest to decipher the genetic code that underlies all life on Earth. The human genome project, completed in 2003, marked a monumental achievement in genomics, revealing the precise sequence of the human DNA. This watershed moment demonstrated the power of genomics in decoding the blueprint of life itself. The idea that we can unravel the genetic instructions that govern our existence has always been a source of profound wonder for me.

### Insights into Evolutionary History
Genomics offers a unique window into the evolutionary history of species. By comparing genomes across organisms, we can trace their shared ancestry, understand how genes have evolved, and gain insights into the forces shaping biodiversity. For instance, the study of homologous genes in diverse species has illuminated the common genetic heritage that binds all life forms. This approach, known as comparative genomics, has revolutionized our understanding of evolution and the interconnectedness of life (Pennisi, 2016).

### Personalized Medicine and Healthcare
One of the most promising applications of genomics is personalized medicine. The ability to analyze an individual's genome can provide critical information about their susceptibility to diseases, drug responses, and even their predisposition to certain conditions. This knowledge enables healthcare professionals to tailor treatments and interventions to a patient's unique genetic makeup, leading to more effective and personalized healthcare (Collins & Varmus, 2015). The potential to transform medicine in this way is both scientifically exhilarating and profoundly impactful for human health.

### Advancements in Genetic Engineering
Genomics also plays a pivotal role in the field of genetic engineering. By manipulating genes and genomes, scientists can develop novel therapies, create genetically modified organisms for various applications, and explore innovative solutions to pressing global challenges, such as crop improvement and disease control (Doudna, 2020). The ethical and practical implications of these advancements make genomics a field ripe for exploration and careful consideration.

### Interdisciplinary Nature
Genomics is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing insights from biology, genetics, bioinformatics, computer science, and ethics, among other fields. This multidisciplinary nature fosters collaboration and drives innovation. As a biologist, I am drawn to the idea of working at the intersection of these diverse disciplines, where groundbreaking discoveries and novel approaches often emerge.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, my passion for genomics as a biologist is rooted in its potential to reveal the mysteries of life, its role in uncovering evolutionary history, its capacity to revolutionize healthcare, its promise for genetic engineering, and its inherently interdisciplinary nature. Genomics has proven itself to be a field with vast scientific and societal implications, and I am excited to be part of the generation of biologists exploring this genomic frontier, advancing our understanding of life, and contributing to the betterment of humanity.
