step 2 Question: What fraction of peaks were retained when intersected compared to sample1? Sample2?
- For sample 1, 103 out of 115 peaks. For sample2, 103 out of 118 peaks. 

step 3 Question: How reproducible are the peaks called between the two samples? Is the p-value range of a peak indicative of reproducibility? Is it completely consistent?
- The reproducibility is quite high, especially for the more prominent peaks (with higher p-values). 
- So Yes, higher p-value is indicative of reproducibility. 
- No it is not completely consistent.
